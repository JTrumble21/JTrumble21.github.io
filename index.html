    <h1 class="fancyHeading">Who is Jessi Oostrom?</h1>
    <p>I am a passionate, outgoing, small town girl, with an entrepreneurial spirit and a love of helping people. I am very creative and artistic, which is why I had always anticipated a career in an artistic field, however, my passion for law prevailed and became my main focus for post secondary education. 
      I have always had a plan in mind on how to help people and how to make a difference in the world. Thanks to triOS college for being 3 out of those 4 steps to creating my vision of helping people.
      I am a triOS College alumni and current student. My web developer diploma is the final step for me to be able to provide the best services in my future business consulting firm.
      I have a a Paralegal diploma, Law Clerk diploma and a Business Management diploma, I plan to combine the knowledge and skills I have obtained from each of these programs and provide a diverse range of services to a range of clients.
